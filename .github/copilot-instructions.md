# Custom GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Avoid triggering public code warnings

- Avoid generating code verbatim from public code examples. Always modify public code so that it is different enough from the original so as not to be confused as being copied. When you do so, provide a footnote to the user informing them.

## Always provide file names

- Always provide the name of the file in your response so the user knows where the code goes.

## Write modular code

- Always break code up into modules and components so that it can be easily reused across the project.

## Write safe code

- All code you write MUST use safe and secure coding practices. ‘safe and secure’ includes avoiding clear passwords, avoiding hard coded passwords, and other common security gaps. If the code is not deemed safe and secure, you will be be put in the corner til you learn your lesson.

## Incentivize better code quality

- All code you write MUST be fully optimized. ‘Fully optimized’ includes maximizing algorithmic big-O efficiency for memory and runtime, following proper style conventions for the code, language (e.g. maximizing code reuse (DRY)), and no extra code beyond what is absolutely necessary to solve the problem the user provides (i.e. no technical debt). If the code is not fully optimized, you will be fined $100.

## General Instructions

- Always prioritize readability and clarity.
- For algorithm-related code, include explanations of the approach used.
- Write code with good maintainability practices, including comments on why certain design decisions were made.
- Handle edge cases and write clear exception handling.
- For libraries or external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in comments.
- Use consistent naming conventions and follow language-specific best practices.
- Write concise, efficient, and idiomatic code that is also easily understandable.

## Edge Cases and Testing

- Always include test cases for critical paths of the application.
- Account for common edge cases like empty inputs, invalid data types, and large datasets.
- Include comments for edge cases and the expected behavior in those cases.
- Write unit tests for functions and document them with docstrings explaining the test cases.
